Strings
delimitation: ",',""".

ascii in 2x, unicode in 3x

print chr(65)

print bin(42)

print oct(42)
print unichr(172)

strings are immutable

we can convert them to a list and then modify

'in' is a membership operator

import string

'banana'.find('n')
returns index

string.rstrip will strip-off white space

%d is a format operator

=====files

open function is the old way

f=file is the new way
f=file(filename,mode,buffering)

mode is r,w,a, or rb,wb,ab
buffering. 0 is unbuffered.
1 is for lines buffered

mode a, appends to the end of the file

raw string:

x = r"C:\test"

this avoids the \t being seen as a tab

try, except, else, finally
