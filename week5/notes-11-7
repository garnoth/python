anagram_dict=pickle.load(f)

you can put a string into a list, modify the string and put it back as a string!

sort() sorts and modifies the list.  sorted() can be printed and does not modify the list

w.extended( [22, 23] )

print w[4:5]

w[2:4] = [3,4] changes those indexes to these values

del w[4]

tuple is a not mutable

t=()
t= tuple()
t = ('a', 3, [17,34,11] )

print t[2]

You can change a list within a tuple
